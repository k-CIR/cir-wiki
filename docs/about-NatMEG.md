NatMEG is the first and only research laboratory in Sweden for whole-head measurements of neuronal brain activity using magnetoencephalography (MEG). The NatMEG lab was  inaugurated in October 2013, and is one out of only approximately 200 active MEG labs worldwide.

Since 2024, we have the worlds largest on-scalp MEG system that uses optically pumped magnetometer (OPM) sensors, a new type of quantum enhanced sensors that can measure closer to the scalp than conventional MEG sensors.
