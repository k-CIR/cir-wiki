---

[mriqc](https://mriqc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) is an open-source tool that automatically extracts image quality metrics (IQMs) from structural, functional, and diffusion MRI data, without needing a reference image. It is designed for minimal preprocessing and is built using modular Nipype workflows that integrate tools like ANTs and AFNI. MRIQC adheres to BIDS and BIDS-App standards for compatibility and follows strong software engineering practices to ensure robustness and reliability, with continuous testing on diverse datasets.
