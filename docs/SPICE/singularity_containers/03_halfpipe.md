[ENIGMA Halfpipe](https://github.com/HALFpipe/HALFpipe) is an intuitive tool designed to streamline reproducible fMRI analysis, covering preprocessing, individual, and group-level analyses. It leverages fMRIPrep for advanced preprocessing without requiring BIDS data conversion, and allows for real-time computation of common resting-state and task-based fMRI metrics.
