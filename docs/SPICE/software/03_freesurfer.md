Freesurfer is not supported on Ubuntu 24, which is the OS on the SPICE. However, it is possible to run FreeSurfer using a Singularity container.

Check out running (fmriprep)[../singularity_containers/01_fmriprep.md] or (halflife)[../singularity_containers/03_halfpipe.md] for examples of how to run Singularity containers that include freesurfer reconstructions.
