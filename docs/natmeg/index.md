title: About NatMEG
---

NatMEG is the first and only research laboratory in Sweden for whole-head measurements of neuronal brain activity using magnetoencephalography (MEG). The NatMEG lab was  inaugurated in October 2013, and is one out of only approximately 200 active MEG labs worldwide.

Since 2024, we have the worlds largest on-scalp MEG system that uses optically pumped magnetometer (OPM) sensors, a new type of quantum enhanced sensors that can measure closer to the scalp than conventional MEG sensors.

For contact details, booking, etc. see [natmeg.se](https://natmeg.se/) where you also find [a video introduction to MEG](https://natmeg.se/learnaboutmeg/meg_popsci/), and lectures from leading researchers on [theory and concepts](https://natmeg.se/learnaboutmeg/meg%20topics/meg%20concepts.html) and [data analysis](https://natmeg.se/learnaboutmeg/meg%20topics/analysis.html).

### Analysis software
Most scripts used at NatMEG rely on one of two well-documented and free software tools available for analysis of MEG and EEG data:

- [MNE](https://mne.tools/stable/index.html) - Python package
- [Fieldtrip](https://www.fieldtriptoolbox.org/) - Matlab toolbox
