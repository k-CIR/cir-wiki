# BIDS for MEG
BIDS (Brain Imaging Data Structure) is a standard for organizing and formatting neuroimaging data. It provides a consistent way to structure data files and directories, making it easier to share and analyze data across different platforms and software.
The BIDS standard is widely used in the neuroimaging community and is supported by many software tools and libraries. By following the BIDS format, researchers can ensure that their data is easily accessible and interpretable by others, facilitating collaboration and reproducibility in neuroimaging research.
