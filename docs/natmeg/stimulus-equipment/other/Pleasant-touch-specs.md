## Pleasant touch stimulation

For pleasant touch stimulation, we use  custom-built 2-arm brush robot system from NatMEG Guest Professor Veikko Jousm√§ki.

The trigger to stimulation delay is completely dependent on brush robot sequences. A combination of brush arm speedometer, accelerometer, load cell and brush touch onset optic sensors are used to assess the movements and stimulation periods.

* Further technical specifications TBA
