## Electric Nerve Stimulation

![Electric Nerve Stimulator]({{ picture_path }}/electric-nerve.png)

For  electrical nerve stimulation, we use two DeMeTec SCG30 stimulators, either with felt tips for median nerve stimulation, or with ring electrodes for single phalange stimulation.

The trigger to stimulation delay is about 3 msec.
