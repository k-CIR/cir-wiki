## Projector specifications

For  visual stimulation, we use  a   FL35 LED  DLP projector from Projection Design.  The current installation runs at 32 bit color in 1920*1080  @  120 fps..  Maximum  field of view for visual presentation is about  63 (horizontal) * 41 (vertical) degrees.

In standard settings (16:9 ratio, 1920x1080 resolution, 120 fps, 100 cm distance), the projector fills a 72 x 44 cm rectangle on the screen, ca 40 x 25 degrees of the visual field.

Presenting a white picture on the screen gives 100 lumen on screen, 30 lumen at eye position.

The visual stimulation is typically controlled via [Neurobs Presentation](../../presentation/01_Presentation.md), in which case  the computer-to-eye delay is about 8 ms, with no frame drops or frame doubles.

* Further technical specifications for the projector are found [here](https://natmeg.se/onewebmedia/602-0740-05%20FL35%20series%20single%20pageEN%20-%20web.pdf).
