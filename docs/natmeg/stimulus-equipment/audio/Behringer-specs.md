# ULTRAGAIN DIGITAL ADA8200
S/N: -

There are two ULTRAGAIN DIGITAL ADA8200 in the lab, one in the Stimulus cabinet (Unit A) and one in the MSR cabinet (Unit B). They are connected to each other via an 8-channel ADAT link.

Unit B receives input from the microphone via the [Amplifier](), sends the signal to Unit A which outputs it to the [Speaker]().

Unit A receives input from the [Audio interface]() and sends the signal to unit B which outputs it to the [MSR speakers amplifier]().

**Some notes of caution:**
 - The ADAT units should never be touched by someone other than the NatMEG core team.
 - Phantom power should always be turned off (=green light).
 - Since the ADAT units are generally always on they tend to only last for a few years. No or cracking sound together with irregular light flashes generally means it is time to replace the unit.

### Full Description
#### ADAT Digital Connectivity
Featuring innovative Cirrus Logic 24-bit A/D – D/A converters the ADA2800 can be used to achieve incredible audio/digital conversion with a detailed and pristine tone. The ADAT inputs and outputs can operated simultaneously or independently with a word clock and operate at either 44.1 or 48 kHz conversion rates both with full 24-bit resolution.

#### Legendary MIDAS Preamps
Loaded with 8 premium MIDAS designed microphone preamps the ADA8200 provides dynamic and crystal clear audio reproduction perfect for commercial quality recordings. Since its founding in the 1970s MIDAS has become one of the world’s leading manufacturers of audio mixing consoles and equipment due to their no compromise philosophy and meticulous design process.
