title: MEG analysis
---

There two major toolboxes for analyzing MEG data: [MNE-Python](https://mne.tools/stable/index.html) and [FieldTrip](https://www.fieldtriptoolbox.org/). Both toolboxes are open source and widely used in the MEG/EEG community. Below are links to tutorials and documentation for getting started with these toolboxes.

- [MNE-Python tutorials](https://mne.tools/stable/auto_tutorials/index.html)
- [FieldTrip tutorials](https://www.fieldtriptoolbox.org/tutorial/)

## NatMEG analysis pipelines

We are currently developing standardized analysis pipelines for NatMEG data using MNE-Python. These pipelines will cover common analysis steps such as preprocessing, source localization, and statistical analysis. Stay tuned for updates!
