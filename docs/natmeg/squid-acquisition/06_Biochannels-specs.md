# Biochannels

The Elekta Neuromag TRIUX   also has 12 integrated bipolar channels, for recording of electrooculgraphy (EOG), electrocardiography (ECG), and electromyography (EMG).

* Further technical specifications are found [here](https://natmeg.se/onewebmedia/NM23083B-A%20Elekta%20Neuromag%20TRIUX%20datasheet.pdf).
* System technical manual is found [here](https://natmeg.se/onewebmedia/NM24132A%20Triux%20TM.pdf).

We currently use the EL508 electrodes and  LEAD108 and LEAD108a from BioPac for most biochannel measurements. We also use  the EL254RT  for facial EMG.
