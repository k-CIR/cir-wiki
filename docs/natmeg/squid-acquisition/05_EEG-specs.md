# Electroencephalography (EEG).

## Procedure

This is preferably a two-person job (running time, approximation).

1.	Try to ask participants for their head-size so you can prepare a cap in advance.
2.	Fit a suitable cap
3.	Measure length from nasion to back-head-bump
    
    > Forehead sensors should be at 10% of the length

4.	Tighten the cap (time: 2 min)

5. Fit the EOG and ECG (EMG) electrodes to the usual spots (to the best of your ability). Some electrodes might be in the way of the EEG-electrodes but that is fine. (time: 6 min)

    > Make sure the settings include the EEG-channels that you want. Otherwise, the digitization program will not recognize them.

6. [Digitize](../preparation/02_Digitization-hpi.md) as usual. You can put the coil on the cap if there is no room. (time: 20 min)

7. Pen procedure (with EEG) (time: 40-60 min)

8. Connect the EEG adapter to the impedance meter.
9. Connect reference and ground to the adapter, there are separate cables available for this.
10. Connect the reference and ground.

11. Fill the EEG-electrodes with gel (person 1) while simultaneously checking the impedance (person 2). Add more gel if needed. You can also use an EEG-needle and carefully scratch the head.

## Specifications

The Elekta Neuromag TRIUX  has an integrated MEG-compatible  128 channel EEG system.

* Further technical specifications are found [here](https://natmeg.se/onewebmedia/NM23083B-A%20Elekta%20Neuromag%20TRIUX%20datasheet.pdf).
* System technical manual is found [here](https://natmeg.se/onewebmedia/NM24132A%20Triux%20TM.pdf).

We currently use [128 channel caps](https://natmeg.se/onewebmedia/BC-128.pdf), [74 channel caps](https://natmeg.se/onewebmedia/BC-MEG-74-X1%20Triux.pdf) and 128-slit custom montage caps from  EasyCap
