# Electrodes (standard setup)

**This is the first part of the preparation which is followed by the [Digitization](02_Digitization-hpi.md)**

The standard setup of electrodes includes:
- 2 horizontal EOG
- 2 vertical EOG
- 2 ECG
- 1 Reference
- 1 Ground


## Material

## Step-by-step guide

1. Place the participant in the wooden chair
2. Use abrasive gel to scrub where Electrodes will be placed. Usually a pie-sized portion on a cotton pad is enough for all electrodes, and 3-5 circular wipes will do.
> ! Be careful and check with the participant so it does not hurt
3. Wipe with alcohol swaps to remove gel. Also wipe positions of the HPI coils.
> ! Warn participant that if might sting a bit
4. After letting the alcohol dry a few seconds attach the electrodes at the location indicated by the picture.
> ! You can cut away part of the electrode (not too much!) to avoid participant getting it in the eye.

### Check impedance

When all electrodes are attached. Check impedance using the impedance meter.

1. Connect the three cables to the electrodes according to their labels. 
2. Click the middle white button to turn SIGGI on and select *Impedance Meter*. Press white button again.
3. Read impedance for each channel, by moving the connector to the different electrodes. **Impedance levels should not be higher than 20 ${k\Omega}$**, but the less the better. If impedance is too high, try to press on the electrode. If the signal is still not good, remove the electrode, clean the skin and attach a new.

When finished with the electrodes move on to the [Digitization](02_Digitization-hpi.md).
